Data Modeling
In this section of the challenge i used QuickDBD to create my diagram with relationships. I had to review the relationship symbols and what the relationships mean again in order to accomplish the diagram. I have attached the complete photo in the github.

Data Engineering
This section is where I created all the tables that were required before doing any analysis work. This area of work was rather simple however i did accidently leave out composite keys which i did go back into and added them in. That step did require me to drop my tables and recreate them as well as import the data all over again.

Data Analysis 
I spent most of my time on this portion of the challenge. I did get stuck on the second analysis where it was required to query a table by who was hired in 1986. I had to refer to Stack Overflow to find out how i can use just the year instead of the whole data. I ended up using the EXTRACT and YEAR FROM method. Doing this section required to do a lot of JOIN therefore after this challenge i am rather familiar with how to use it effectively.
